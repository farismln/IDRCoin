# [H-04] The `BankHub::revokeWhiteList` function does not update the `whiteListed` state to false, allowing malicious banks to retain privileged access as whitelisted banks.

## Finding description and impact

The `BankHub::revokeWhiteList` function does not correctly update the `whiteListed` state to false when a bank is removed from the whitelist. As a result, the bank continues to be treated as a whitelisted entity, retaining its privileged access.

This issue has significant consequences. Malicious banks are able to exploit this vulnerability, still benefiting from the special privileges granted to whitelisted banks. Even more concerning, these banks are still able to obtain IDRCoin loans, despite the fact that the IDRCoin was previously withdrawn by the `BankHub`. This could lead to potential financial losses and manipulation of the system by unauthorized banks.

## Proof of Concept


```js
    // revoke whitelist from partner bank
    // collect all IDRCoin from bank
    // this is used to punish bank that misbehave
    function revokeWhiteList(address _bank) external onlyOwner {
        if (idrcoin.balanceOf(_bank) > 0) {
            idrcoin.transferFrom(_bank, owner, idrcoin.balanceOf(_bank));
        }
    }
```

The `revokeWhiteList` function only transfers the IDRCoin balance from the revoked bank to the owner, but it does not update the `whiteListed` status to false.

To verify this findings, add the following test to `Base.t.sol`:

```js
    function test_revokeWhitelistDoesNotUpdateTheWhitelistedState() public {
        vm.startPrank(admin);
        bankHub.revokeWhiteList(bankABC);
        vm.stopPrank();

        // assert
        assertEq(bankHub.isWhiteListed(bankABC), true);
    }
```

then run `forge test --mt test_revokeWhitelistDoesNotUpdateTheWhitelistedState`. the test would PASS:

```bash

## Recommended mitigation steps

Set the `whiteListed` state at malicious bank to false as shown in code below:
